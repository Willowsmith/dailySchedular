Creating a simple and easy to use daily scheduler that would keep the items a user put in and track the day and time of day.

-My motivation was to create code to create a way to schedule tasks that was interactive and responsive. 

-I built this project so that I could learn how to use code to save information into local storage, utilize the moments methods, and allow for dynamic functionality. 

-The problem that I solved were getting the text to show on the page, saving the data, and showing the current date and time. 

-I learned about moments and setting data into local storage.
